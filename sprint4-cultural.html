            <h4><em>what is it?</em></h4>
            <p>
                A new way of thinking about the brain essentially. Neuroplasticity takes a non deterministic
                view of human potential. Where the previous concensus was built on the idea of intelligence
                being fixed once the brain had fully developed, the newer concensus is that the brain can form
                new synaptic pathways and strengthen them based on intillectual and environmental inputs. Since
                the 70's and 80's Neuroplasticity has gained wide acceptance through the scientific community
                as a complicated but fundimental reality of the human brain.

                    that the brain changes its very structure with each different activity it performs, perfecting
                    its circuits so it is better suited to the task at hand."</em>

                Channelling these ideas into your life can be daunting if you view it as a whole, but I would advise
                anyone interested, to bite themself off small achievable chunks. You can become more neuroplastic by
                working out regularly, eating well, sleeping at least 8 hours a night, reading a book, travelling to 
                another country, learning a new language etc.

               No one can do everything at once, and everyone has different commitments and responsibilities. No 
               progress will be made if youre just adding stressors to achieve more in the same amount of day.
               I feel like a good approach to start is by identifying some short term goals, that allign with your 
               interests and frame them with a...

            <h2>What is a Growth Mindset and how can we use it?</h2>
            <p>
                The easiest way to think about the growth mindset is to consider what it isnt. 
                states:
                <br>
                <br>
                <em> "in a fixed mindset, students believe their basic ablities, their intelligence, their talents, are 
                just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart
                all the time and never to look dumb."</em>

            <p>
                A growth mindset challenges this notion by placing emphasis and reward on effort and persistance, not the 
                educational outcomes themselves. 'I dont know now but I will know soon' encapsulates the relevance for coding;
                a bottomless and everchanging branch of the tech world, where its much more important to lean the tools of learning
                to help you stay relevant, than it is to be infinately knowledgable using the current tools. 
                <br>It suprised me to discover how intrinsic and obvious this feels to me, knowing we arnt born with the skills 
                to drive cars, speak languages, or play guitar but these are skills both developed in the musculature and the mind with
                practice and habit. <br> Despite this however the other suprise was just how defeatist my thoughts have been throughout
                foundations. When it comes to anything remotely resembling mathmatics felt so intimidating, so reminiscent of past faliures, 
                that I need keep aware of the feeling of mental fog, staring at the screen inertia, and maintain habits around getting fresh
                air, and just caring to my basic needs emotionally. Its just like driving a car, you just need to put the hours in.
