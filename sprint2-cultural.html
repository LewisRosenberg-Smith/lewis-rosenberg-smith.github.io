        <p>Now that i'm here at dev academy I feel like my long term goals are coming into focus for the first time in a
            long time. The primary goal is stability and health in my lifetime, supported by an impetus to continually
            learn and grow. The more I learn through the sprints, the more it seems like web development is the answer
            to those questions. I want to be able to make things that are useful to people in digital spaces and I
            really like how much possibility is being unlocked by learning these skills.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>The human skill i've identified as a personal shortfall for a long time is how long i've been in competitive
            work environments and how guarded that has made me about open collabouration and learning. Learning a bit
            more about the flipped learning model and learning remotely has been kind of confronting. I'm in a cohort
            but to an extent the responsibility for reaching out, managing my feelings of frustration and inadequacy and
            maintaining learning discipline is all up to me. When bootcamp starts im confident that ill be able to take
            those learnings and apply myself in a way thats useful to others. The key to managing my workload in the
            programme is to just follow what I learned in the "thinking like a programmer" section about catching
            yourself before you enter the frustration spiral. To recognise when you are stuck and be methodical. Its not
            dissimmilar in approach to fault finding a technical issue in my prefvious job, so I feel I have a
            framework, I just need to apply it.
        </p>
        <p>I've been helped out a lot by Edgars, but i'm also getting a lot better at reading documentation. I think the
            times where im truly stuck without much ability to move foward are starting to thin out, as it pertains to
            HTML and CSS in any case. My expectations of the Dev Academy team are basically to be there to support us
            when we hit that point. If I cant solve an issue and im stuck, after I accurately identify the problem
            search for a solution, ask another member of the cohort, if im still dead in the water, I expect that there
            will be a lifeline there for me to call on.</p>
        <p>I feel that currently I'm ready and able to give this course my all. I might have very sporadic obligations
            for a physio visit once a week but I dont have any daily commitments besides the work. Im also really
            looking forward to participating in the yoga :)</p>
