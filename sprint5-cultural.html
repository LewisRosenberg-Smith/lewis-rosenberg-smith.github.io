        <h3>what suprised me most about learning core is</h3> -->
        <!-- <p>
            The process of putting into practice being so difficult for me. I felt like at the start of the foundations
            there was a fairly even balance between time spent on core learning and technical learning but as the corse
            picked up in difficulty around sprint 3 my focus for core learning went out the window. part of this is an
            arrogance i pbserve in myself. The sense that as an empathetic person, core comes naturally to me, and that
            because coding doesnt, more time needs to be spent learning the logic of problem solving, the syntax, the
            dopcumentation. all of that.
            but i think alot of my issues in approaching the problems the wrong way, the core helps to teach, i think i
            just found it really difficuylt working alone. i dont enjoy sitting alone in front of a screen 7 days a
            week, i didnt find i had the energy to really invest time into core learning openly without cynacism because
            the coding journey was so exhausting and so unsupported that by the time that was done i just wanted to be
            outside or in the kitchen or playing guitar or doing literally anything else. i feel like this reflects a
            lack of commitment on some level on my part to really incorperating the growth mindset in particular. so
            much negative self talk internally about how im never going to get certain concepts, or second guessing
            where i am relative to others in the course, when really i should be not in competition with anyone and that
            this is an oppertunity to get me closer to my own learning goals. were not all starting on an even playing
            field. and the course doesnt even out the playing field either. so the idea of spending so much time and
            energy in negative comparisons was honestly wasted time.

            I dont know if I speak for anyone else in this cohort, but sitting in my feelings at the end of sprint 5
            feels like a moment of relief, after having spent so much time submerged in granular detail; to be able to
            take a step back and reflect on how short a span of time this has actually been, and how much ground has
            been covered since installing and configuring git! When I had an interview with Dougall for placement in the
            cohort I was well briefed about what we were to be building and at what step, but experiencing it all is
            another thing entirely, so first of all congratulations to everyone for participating and making it through
            the sprints. If your experience was anything like mine, this tested you. It certainly taught me a few things
            about myself that suprised me.

                    Previous failiures would come back to haunt me. Despite believing wholeheartedly in the principles
                    of
                    the growth mindset and neuroplasticity, I had internalised long ago that I am terrible at maths.
                    This is
                    very much a product of learning environments I was in when I was very young and doesnt really have
                    much
                    bearing on my potential today. But I was suprised at just how powerful the feelings of defeat and
                    frustration were. Just how hard it was to apply the core learning to a long unacknowledged dark
                    corner
                    of my brain. And just how useful I found listening and looping with others, for grounding what I
                    feel in
                    some sense of common experience with others.

                    I learned that committing to mindfullness practice every day was easier said than done! Finding the
                    time
                    to be in a relaxed quiet environment without distractions was quite difficult for me at first. Ive
                    since
                    taken to a few local cafes oddly to escape the ambient conversational noise of my home, and the
                    neighbouring construction sites, in order to get a good 5 minutes of attention training.

                <li>
                    The most profound thing I learned about my ego is that this core learning is absolutely a nescessary
                    and crucial part of my time here that I dont want to waste. I think I came into the sprints really
                    cocky about the core stuff. And was fundamentally really suprised by how quickly my ability to be
                    reflective patient and efficient broke down as the stress of grappling with the technical learning
                    started to amplify.

                Empathy and self awareness in learning and programming are relevant for maintaining the trajectory of
                your critical thinking. Programming requires you to problem solve in ways the are quite comprehensive,
                and require a critical approach. Its heavy heavy brain work and in the words of a programmer friend of
                mine "you are trying to drink the ocean". The work can frustrate and perspective is crucial for
                maintaining your focus, so you must not aim that criticality on yourself or others. You need empathy and
                self awareness to manage the emotional work that comes with this practice. You need it for fostering and
                contributing to positive work cultures. You need it for maintaining a sense of curiosity and persistance
                as you work through what youre doing.

                As a coder, in todays software landscape, its very likely youre going to end up a contributing part of a
                wider organisation. If you want to be percieved as an asset from an employers perspective these core
                learnings have immensely far reaching potential. I dont think any of us want to neatly slot into the
                paradigm of the anti social programmer, which seems to prevalent in the stories of my more creatively
                minded friends in tech. As such its no coincidence for Dev Academy to be teaching these skills in a way
                that weighs them so equally with the core technical curriculum. Employers want coders who are warm
                hearted, potentially client facing, socially cohesive people, and for the most part they understand the
                potential for much higher productivity and learning in individuals with good core grounding.

                Lastly in all honestly there were times where in the moment I felt massively behind where I wanted to be
                in core technical competencies. It was really hard to stop short of really grasping a concept, to work
                on submitting and pushing a blog. I felt like my site is badly designed. The blogs im pushing are badly
                formatted, and the core technical skills are demanding so much cognitive bandwidth. In the end though
                the time developing core skills, is and should be seen as time developing the skills to cope with that
                frustration as you go. Doing this course in the first place is an act of condensing an absolute tonne of
                knowledge into a very very short time. There is bound to be a sense of frustration when youre just
                getting to grips with something that feels fundamental and already youve moved on before youve felt
                really in command of the bedrock. I think despite having felt these emotions, I cant justify them to
                myself in the end. To channel the principles of mindfullness, I have to acnowledge those feelings
                without judgement and allow them to pass.
