        <br>
        <p>The path that lead me to Wellington and Dev-Academy began about 4 years ago, when I had reached the end of my
            tether working as a AV tech for a live events company. As any venue worker, hospo contractor or performer
            will
            tell you, gig economy work can be terribly isolating socially, and extremely competetive. Everybody is
            competing
            over a share of a rather small pie in New Zealands entertainment industry, and while there were technicians
            more
            experienced than me, I had a good grasp of the soft skills required to maintain good client relations over
            the
            course of long events. That lead to a situation where after years of overwork I was so fatigued and
            dissillusioned that I quit my job and moved to Melbourne to try to pursue a new start.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Melboure life suited me well. Its a wonderfully engaging, dense and culturally rich place to live, and I had
            many
            wonderful experiences there that showed me there was more to life than the quarter mile radius of commuting
            working and sleeping that was my life.I had the opportunity to camp out in the Grampians National Park, walk
            the
            Kokoda track Memorial Walk in the Dandenong. Perhaps most spectacularly of all, I fulfilled a lifelong dream
            of
            seeing the Great Barrier Reef with my own eyes on a 10 day stay on NorthWest Island.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately things were about to take somewhat of a turn.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After travelling back to New Zealand for 7 days for a good friends wedding I had a suprise health scare that
            lead
            to a shock cancer diagnosis. Its impossible to describe what it feels like to hear those words when youre in
            your late 20s. It simply feels like something that only happens to other older people. People with some sort
            of
            genetic risk factor that would explain it. Needless to say the following surgury recovery and monitoring
            program
            changed everything for me. I still had a lease in Melbourne yet here I was in a hospital bed with no income
            in
            Auckland, unable to get up unassisted and enrolled in a treatment regime that required regular checkups,
            blood
            tests, scans. The love and support of others made that time endurable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One thing I feel its unavoidable to learn when you meet mortality from a distance is not to wait for life. I
            became even more determined to change my career to something that would offer more stability. I wanted to
            live
            somewhere I enjoyed. I wanted to hone the skills required to open up working remotely for myself. I wanted
            to
            live with the love of my life. Thankfully there came an oppertunity! My partner got a job offer for her
            first
            gamedev job, for a company located in Upper Hutt. A flat became available in Thorndon through a personal
            connection and I have long admired Wellingtons geography and urban culture. So we jumped at the chance!</p>

        <br>
        <p>Then a month and a half later we're in COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This gave me no choice. I had to get out of events work. There were no more touring acts, no more open
            venues, no
            more local festivals. The career change had to happen now. So I asked around some of my Wellington developer
            mates, and Dev-Academy came up several times from several people. That about takes us to the present! If you
            have gotten this far thanks for reading :) and look forward to lots more walls of text as I reflect further
            on
            my background, learning and values. Its good to be alive.</p>
