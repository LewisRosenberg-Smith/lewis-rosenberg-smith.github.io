<!-- PSEUDOCODE
A way to notate the logic of what your code hopes to achieve, without worrying about syntax.

suggestions of ways to do it. 

-capitalise key commands ie IF number is > 10 THEN..) This helps funnel you toward more
 effective code choice, and keeps the internal logic at the centre of your focus.

-Stick to one statement per line. Each statement is expressing one action. keep it simple 
and systematic.

-use indentation. Employ code readability principles to your psudocode to keep seperate blocks
visually seperated. And any code that should be nested as is dictated by your logic, is.

-be specific. Everything you want to happen must be described completely. write it with another
user in mind. Could a stranger follow your psudocode?

-keep it simple. Pseudocode doesnt need to be code. It needs to be a clear description of the aims
of the code.

 <!-- RUBBER DUCKY

 The rubber ducky method basically describes a method of problem solving method that hinges on
  vocalising the problem youre trying to solve. Explaining a problem to someone or something
  that has no experience with it. This phenomenon gets its name from the fact that explaining 
  our problem to a colleague or a friend often works so well for telling you what you got wrong,
  even before youve finished explaining, that you may as well just buy a duck and tell it that!
  You have to slow down, deconstruct, add context, your intention.  -->

          <p>
              Learning to put JS into practice with the Katas was really where the rubber hit the road. 
              <br> The problems. Hoooo boy there were a lot of problems. It turns out my prior successes 
              getting code working in code camp, or even getting through the manipulating the dom challenge
              was kinda dependant on there being examples of pre written code for me to refer to. There are too 
              many problems to adress here but the main one that really got me was during the JS Gradebook Kata.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating the function average was where I really came unstuck. I knew from previous meetings with
                my coach that the way you affect values in an array one by one is usually going to be a loop, but after 
                I Pseudocoded for myself what I wanted my logic to do. I wanted it to add each array value together to 
                create the sum, which I defined as Total. With help from my coach, I caught a mistake of using the +
                not the += operator, resulting in the total finally being added to itself as it iterates through the loop.
                After getting a bit flustered with minor mistakes, and very much in the mindset of using dot notation to
                add properties to objects..I didnt write the return statement! When that was pointed out to me it also didnt
                occur to me that I could use the quotient operator in the return statement, which made my code a lot cleaner
                and enabled me to have my mean average value. I learned something I probably should already know. That a function
                will not excecute without a return statement, and that return statements can be flexible. A seperate function 
                using the quotient operator wasnt nescessary because I have `total/ scores.length`
            </p>
            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>
                I feel like with pseudocode I still have a lot to learn. Its a really useful mental excersise for me first and formost
                to think about JS as a process of excecuting logical statements. That part I find helps my process, and helps keep me 
                thinking about the big picture. But to a certain extent you still have to understand what logic the language will accept.
                I often find myself writing pseudocode which reflects how I think a problem can be solved. And then have to change it to 
                reflect what logic the computer understands.
            </p>
            <h3>Trying something</h3>
            <p>
                Still not very confident with this. A lot of my attempts to solve the tests in these Katas wuold have been helped by declaring
                more variables and messing around with it. I think I overemphesise the time pressure of the sprints, and when things dont work and
                I cant understand why, my creativity in trying things unravels.
            </p>
            <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
            <p>
                I love this method. Ive had the privilage of having a few friends who are dev literate be my soundboard but truthfully the ducky
                method hasnt worked to reveal solutions to problems im having, but it is providing really good practice verbalising what im doing,
                so I can feel a sense of what im doing and where im at.
            </p>
            <h3>reading error messages</h3>
            <p>
                truthfully I am currently terrible at this. Unexpected token or illegal return statement for instance, I am slowly learning that its 
                NOT telling me to get rid of the thing its pointing to at the specific line of code, it is telling me im asking javascript to do something
                its not supposed to do.
            </p>
            <h3>console.logging</h3>
            <p>
                Again, not very confident yet, but am building confidence more as the work requires me to use it more. Broadly speaking I just dont have the 
                sense yet of where its utility is in my process. I still have so many issues with syntax that a console.log function often wont pass to help me 
                determine where other errors are.
            </p>
            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>
                best friend worst enemy. Ive used it to get myself out of many jams, but its also really hard to know whats the right answer, and a few times 
                ive travelled faaaaaaaar in the wrong direction, due to misunderstanding what my problem really is.
            </p>
            <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
            <p>
                Im getting pretty comforatable with this actually. At first it was really difficult becuase it felt like I was just so far behind everyone else in 
                course that was present in the chat. But now as more people are vocal and i've done some listening and looping excersises, i'm having an easier time of it
            </p>
            <h3>Asking Coaches for help</h3>
            <p>
                Easily this is getting me through the most. The coaches who have helped me are honestly pretty responsible for the concepts actually landing for me.
                I feel really comfortable leaning on the coaches, when I just find myself irreperably stuck. I perhaps shouldnt wait so long before I use their services
                but I wanted to give myself a chance to really try solve some of these on my own.
            </p>
            <h3>reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Reflection is a hard one honestly for this sprint. Previous sprints ive really enjoyed it and got alot from it. But for the katas by the time ive hit my wits 
                end for the day I just am completely emotionally and physically exhausted. Mindfullness cant replace a good night sleep and after i wake up theres another 8 hours 
                of programming to do. This week i think i honestly failed to make sufficient time to reflect. And will need to improve apon this area for the final sprint.
