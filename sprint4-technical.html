<!-- PSEUDOCODE
A way to notate the logic of what your code hopes to achieve, without worrying about syntax.

suggestions of ways to do it. 

-capitalise key commands ie IF number is > 10 THEN..) This helps funnel you toward more
 effective code choice, and keeps the internal logic at the centre of your focus.

-Stick to one statement per line. Each statement is expressing one action. keep it simple 
and systematic.

-use indentation. Employ code readability principles to your psudocode to keep seperate blocks
visually seperated. And any code that should be nested as is dictated by your logic, is.

-be specific. Everything you want to happen must be described completely. write it with another
user in mind. Could a stranger follow your psudocode?

-keep it simple. Pseudocode doesnt need to be code. It needs to be a clear description of the aims
of the code.

 <!-- RUBBER DUCKY

 The rubber ducky method basically describes a method of problem solving method that hinges on
  vocalising the problem youre trying to solve. Explaining a problem to someone or something
  that has no experience with it. This phenomenon gets its name from the fact that explaining 
  our problem to a colleague or a friend often works so well for telling you what you got wrong,
  even before youve finished explaining, that you may as well just buy a duck and tell it that!
  You have to slow down, deconstruct, add context, your intention.  -->
