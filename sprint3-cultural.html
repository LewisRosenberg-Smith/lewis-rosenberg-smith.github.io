        <h2>EQ.</h2>
        <h4><em>head and heart</em></h4>
        <p>Emotional intelligence describes the skill of awareness of ones own emotional state, the empathic connections that allow us to navigate the emotions of others and the translation of that skill to the personal and professional world. To cultivate Emotional Intelligence you have to reflect on your own emotional states, even the stressors like frustration or sadness, and work to identify and manage them.</p>
        <h4><em>"The only way to change someone's mind is to connect with them from the heart."
            <br> 
            -Rasheed Ogunlaru</em></h4>
            <p>Emotional intelligence can be practiced internally by Attention training or mindfullness. Follow your attention from simple and deliberate breaths, to non judementally allowing thoughts to enter your mind and pass, like a leaf in a flowing stream. Another internally focused way of cultivating EQ in ones self is journalling. Journalling being a reflection of your thoughts in the present moment, recorded as is. A brain to page record of sorts however uninspired, its purpose is to be present and to process what youre feeling constructively.</p>
            <h2>Listening and Looping</h2>
            <p>A way to practice EQ externally is to practice concious listening with others. Giving them your full attention without the impetus to speak yourself. Try to loop back to the person what you heard them say. Only ask for clarification when you arnt interrupting them, and try to connect with the feelings behind the words. 
                I personally excersised listening and looping with a member of my cohort and felt connection to his experience, when discussing periods of hardship in the previous weeks study, where before I had felt very isolated and alone. Tools like listening and looping are part of how Emotional Intelligence becomes an asset to not only building more empathetic societies in a broad sense, but performing well in your career too.</p>
                <h2>IQ and EQ</h2>
                <p>I think the superficial difference between IQ and EQ is, one refers to a concept of general cognitive intelligence and one refers to emotional intelligence. But to dig a little deeper I think they closely resemble the ideology of the time in which they were concieved. IQ was first conceptualised in the early 1900's where it was far less controversial to assume a notion of intelligence as a measure of <em>potential</em>. Where your intelligence is measured as a capacity to solve arbitraty puzzles that test your numerical, linguistic and spacial reasoning. Contemporary learnings of Neuroplasticity and analysis of environmental factors tell us that IQ scores can go up or down in direct proportion to affecting the test recipients environment, raising serious questions about the historic use of IQ as a measure of academic potential.</p>
                <p>EQ on the other hand was concieved in the 90's in response to the limitations of IQ and the challenge to any concensus of how to measure general intelligence. EQ is framed as a skill you can learn through defined methods of practice, which I think reflects modern notions of learning potential being fluid. </p>
