        <h2>HTML CSS & Javascript.</h2>
        <h4><em>...The three musketeers...</em></h4>
        <p>Everything you see on webpages is comprised of three different interacting systems. The HTML is the filesystem that governs how the content is structured, and the map the page uses to find picture files, or infact CSS or Javascript files the web also needs. I liken this to a reptile like a dinosaur in that it looks pretty old school and is pretty cold blooded. Without the accompanying CSS and Javascript files, your content is there but it doesnt look very cool or do anything interesting.</p>
        <p>CSS is the bird of paradise. It is the aesthetic language of your content. You can use CSS to style your page, colour elements, decide how elements respond to scrolling and resizing. It is the layer of webpages that concerns itself primarily with design. Your HTML file needs to link to your CSS file, so it can reference what CSS statements you have written, but it is the CSS file that does the heavy lifting for readibility and usability.</p>
        <p>The last musketeer is Javascript. The chameleon! The most flexabile and perhaps reactive component of modern webpages. Javascript is the filesystem and programming language that controls a page's moving parts. By that I mean, every time you see a button that changes colour when you mouse over it, a sound that plays on click, a new paragraph, created with nice fade animations when you click a dropdown, that is all javascript at work. Think of Javascript like the source of interactive elements of your design.</p>
        <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <h4><em>...and your daily commute...</em></h4>
        <p>Hold that thought! I want to take you down the garden path for a minute. Another way to think about what Javascript is doing, and how that relates to control flow, is youre actually building a logic into your web page. Sure you can program a page to do this thing, then that thing. You can ask it if this thing is true or false. This however requires you to be writing statements for each of these conditions manually, which you can do, but if you use <em>loops</em> you can instead define the criteria of what you want the function to do, and excecute its own logic.</p>
        <p>OK back to control flow, and our automotive analogy. Everyday when a commuter goes to work, if they do so in theyre own vehicle, from a certain perspective, they have to excecute a series of commands in a certain order. Check the car is in Neutral, turn the ignition key, release the handbrake, put the car in gear, and start driving onto the road where a whole set of other parameters come into play! Think about control flow this way. You want to get comfortable enough with the commute that the logic of how to drive and follow the road rules, is so clearly defined that you dont have to think about each function as youre excecuting it. You just know which side of the road to drive on, where your brake pedal is, and how to give way safely, because you are in a flow state. The rules are clearly defined and youre following them semi autonimously. 
           <p> Programming works this way too. Use loops to define how a script is to function, define your conditions in the right order, following control flow correctly and you wont crash!</p>
           <h2>The DOM</h2>
           <h4><em>...and live performance...</em></h4>
           <p>The DOM is an acronym for the Document Object Model; a programming interface contained within a browser that most people dont really ever see unless they accidentally push F12! When not pursuing web design objectives, we think about web pages as a user experience. How nice they are to use, how fast they load, how readable they are, how many broken links there are etc. But a web page is just a document with a bunch of content, links and source code. The browser is delivering you a user experience by compiling that code and outputting a slick well designed outcome. However...push F12 and all of a sudden you can see the source code, pulling back the curtain and seeing the backstage area if you will. The DOM is an engine you can use to view and even change the building blocks of a website in real time.</p>
           <p>By source code I dont just mean the HTML either. The DOM has your HTML, CSS, Javascript, performance metrics, security information and much more all in one place. Due to its nature to be flexible its a profoundly useful tool when building a page, you can see a visual representation of the changes youre making, run scripts and check for errors, add and remove content all without actually committing changes to your core document.</p>
           <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>
           <h4><em>...and reading books...</em></h4>
           <p>Arrays and Objects are two ways you can form datasets in Javascript. Before we jump into any analogies lets define our terms.</p>
           <p><em>An array is a named collection of values, represented as a list. An object is a named collection of properties.</em></p>
           <p>This sounds unclear but think about it in terms of say, reading a book. If youre discussing with a friend a book you both like, it can be useful to use the page number to refer to a part of the book you want to discuss. You can visualise an array this way. An array is a list of values that are all assigned number (or index) values that represent where in the dataset they are. [0] first value [1] second value [2] third value and so on.</p>
           <p>Back to our reading example though sometimes you want to recall a part of the book you liked using a different descriptor. What about the name of a chapter? This is the way to think about objects. Like classes in CSS objects are defined by not just the number of datapoints in the object but particular keyworded properties. If a book was an object, its properties could be defined as pages, paragraphs, chapters etc and the property becomes how we access the data.</p>

           <h2>Functions</h2>
           <h4><em>..."cant someone else do it?"...</em></h4>
           <p>A function is simply a block of code designed to perform a task. Isnt that what all code is? Just commands to do stuff? Well yes, but functions offer us many advantages over just putting all code we want to excecute in order on a page.</p>
           <li> For Readability. As your page and thus your code grows in complexity, it can be far more readable for others your working with to have code isolated to functions. People can immediately scroll through or keyword search the part of the code they want to view without having to read every keyword in sequence</li>
           <li> For Reusability. Once you have written a function you can call it (excecute it) as many times as you like within the program without writing duplicate code.</li>
           <li> Testing. Because functions should minimize the amount of code you have to write by providing resuable commands, you dont have to test as much code, due to there being less new code required in the first place!</li>
           <p>Its just easier and more powerful to let functions pull some of the weight for you!</p>
